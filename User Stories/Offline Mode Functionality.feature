Feature: Offline Mode Functionality
The system must provide an Offline mode allowing users to access basic features without internet connectivity.

    Scenario: User downloads museum content for offline use
        Given the user has internet connectivity
        When the user selects the "Download for Offline Use" option
        Then the system displays available content categories for download
        And the system shows the estimated storage space required
        And the system downloads the selected museum content to the device
        And the system confirms successful completion of the download

    Scenario: User navigates the museum in Offline mode
        Given the user has previously downloaded museum content
        When the user loses internet connectivity
        Then the system automatically switches to Offline mode
        And the system displays a notification about limited functionality
        And the system continues to display the museum map and pre-downloaded exhibit information

    Scenario: System detects Offline mode and provides guidance
        Given the user has not downloaded museum content
        When the user loses internet connectivity
        Then the system automatically switches to Offline mode
        And the system displays "Unavailable data"

    Scenario: User attempts to access online-only features while offline
        Given the user is in Offline mode
        When the user attempts to access a feature requiring connectivity (e.g., Exhibit Traffic updates)
        Then the system displays "This feature is unavailable!"
        And the system provides an option to retry when connectivity is restored

    Scenario: System synchronizes data when returning online
        Given the user has been using the application in Offline mode
        When internet connectivity is restored
        Then the system detects the connection and notifies the user
        And the system synchronizes any user activity data (e.g., favourites, ratings) with the server
        And the system updates any changed museum information

    Scenario: User views offline map with limited functionality
        Given the user is in Offline mode
        When the user views the museum map
        Then the system displays the pre-downloaded map with basic navigation
        And the system indicates that real-time features are unavailable
        And the system continues to show the user's last known position
        And the system allows basic path planning using pre-downloaded data

    Scenario: User manages offline content storage
        Given the user has downloaded content for offline use
        When the user accesses the "Manage Offline Content" settings
        Then the system displays all downloaded content categories with their storage usage
        And the system allows the user to delete specific content to free up space
        And the system provides an option to update outdated offline content when online
