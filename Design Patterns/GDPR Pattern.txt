The GDPR Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that ensures controlled access to sensitive user data in compliance with GDPR principles. It uses a proxy class (ProxyUserData) to mediate access to the actual data (RealUserData), enforcing authorization rules and protecting sensitive information. This approach helps maintain data privacy, restrict unauthorized access, and align with GDPR's data protection requirements.
