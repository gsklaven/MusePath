The Museum GPS Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that integrates an external indoor positioning system into a museum's GPS system while abstracting its complexity. The MuseumGpsProxy acts as a boundary and adapts the functionality of the IndoorPositioningSystemLib to the MuseumGpsProxyInterface, providing methods for retrieving user and exhibit locations and calculating distances. This pattern ensures modularity, simplifies interaction with the external library, and allows the GpsSystemController to interact with the system through a unified interface, improving maintainability and flexibility.
