The diagram represents an Abstract Factory system that dynamically supports multiple platforms —Android, iOS— using an EnvironmentalManager 
to select the appropriate factory at runtime. Each factory creates a proxy (DeviceCapabilitiesProxy) that provides platform-specific 
functionalities, such as retrieving GPS locations, determining device orientation, and managing notifications. 
This design complies with Non-Functional Requirement 32, ensuring compatibility with both iOS and Android operating systems. 
It is also extensible, allowing new devices to be integrated easily by adding new factories and proxies without altering existing components.
